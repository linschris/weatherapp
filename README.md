# Weather App
### A small, neat weather app to dip my toes into APIs, utilizing OpenWeatherAPI to retrieve weather info.
- The website is available at https://linschris-weatherapp.glitch.me/
##### For this project, there's only a few things to look into:
* Server-side API calls
    * I've made client-side API calls in the browser before, but yeah pre-flighting for CORS is a big no-no for me.
* Utilizing raw information
    * I transformed the information I received from the API to fit the aethestic of the web application.

##### Current things to think about:
* Touching up CSS and making the web application more responsive (mobile mainly)
* Adding more details
